Use rather shapes with curveVertex, no beziers
Main reason being anomalies that result for small angles. (p1 - anchor - p2)

VARIATE:

use alpha as function of invDistIJ ? - not at all - from 1 to alpha - from 0 to alpha

transparency different for line(circleI, circleJ) and anchorPointCurve

draw line btw. intersection points ?

- mostly not, the resulting scene becomes too busy

number of circles

circle size distribution - mean & extremes
